## Summary
> This project is a <b>STOCK INVENTORY SYSTEM</b> for the <i>Department of Science and Technology - Region III</i> to keep track of stock, supplies and sales to easily locate what items are available as well as the location in which they are stored at. It will monitor stock control by making use of a system in which will incorporate the MERN - Mongo + Express + React + Node Stack Framework.

## System Description
> To manage and conduct a good business, for the organization's welfare, implementing an inventory system is of importance. This is to reduce costs while increasing efficiency at the same time.

> For the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), this is especially relevant as one of their foundations is on transparency. So with the stock inventory system, the general public are able to ensure that their taxes are made into good use.

## MERN - Mongo + Express + React + Node Stack

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

* MongoDB — document database
* Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
* React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework
* Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server

<b>MERN use cases</b>

Like any web stack, you can build whatever you want in MERN — though it’s ideally suited for cases that are JSON-heavy, cloud-native, and that have dynamic web interfaces. Examples include workflow management, news aggregation, to-do apps and calendars, and interactive forums/social products — and whatever else you can dream up!

## Possible Sub-systems

</p>
Using the case diagram that is provided above, a good approach for this matter is by making use of an <b>AUDIT LOG</b> in which the following are possible sub-systems we can deduce them from:

1. <b>User Login Information</b> - to keep tabs on whoever is in-charge with handling the inventory
2. <b>Timestamp</b> - contains the date and time of the database where information was last modified
3. <b>Order Tracker</b> - displays the current order status as well as the estimated date of arrival of the deliveries
